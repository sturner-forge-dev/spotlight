          <Tool title="16” MacBook Pro, M3 Pro, 64GB RAM (2023)">
            I was using an Intel-based 16” MacBook Pro prior to this and the
            difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
            single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through
            with our various launch simulations.

          <Tool title="BenQ Programming Monitor (32”)">
            I was admittedly skeptical of the practicality of a
            programming-specific monitor... But after owning this one for a few
            months, I have completely bought in to the hype.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Mode Keyboards Sonnet">
            I’ve been piecing keyboards together for a few years now and this is
            my most current build. Just the right amount of clack and tactile
            feedback and the manufacturing quality is top notch.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Apple Magic Trackpad">
            Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with
            special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard with special
            powers.

          <Tool title="Herman Miller Aeron Chair">
            If I’m going to slouch in the worst ergonomic position imaginable
            all day, I might as well do it in an expensive chair.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
          <Tool title="VSCode">
            I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
            else relies on, VSCode is still the best text editor ever made.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Warp">
            I guess we’re just putting AI in everything now. That being said, I
            like the customizability and ease of use that Warp provides.
          </Tool>
        </ToolsSection>
        <ToolsSection title="Design">
          <Tool title="Figma">
            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.

        <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
          <Tool title="Alfred">
            It’s not the newest kid on the block but it’s still the fastest. The
            VSCode of the application launcher world.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Reflect">
            Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
            organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
            Reflect, it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
            discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
            daily note.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="SavvyCal">
            Great tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my calendar and
            making sure I still have lots of time for deep work during the week.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Focus">
            Simple tool for blocking distracting websites when I need to just do
            the work and get some momentum going.
